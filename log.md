# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I've been doing FreeCodeCamp exercises for the past few days, but today I actually decided to make a noticable progress. I'm currently working on the Responsive Web Design Certification, and have managed to finish the 'Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu' and 'Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers' courses. At the end of my study session, I'm at [259] total points on FreeCodeCamp.

**Study Time:** 2 hours
